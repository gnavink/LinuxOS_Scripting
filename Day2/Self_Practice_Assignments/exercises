1) Selects only the filesystems having xfs in /etc/fstab

awk -F ' '  '/xfs/ { print $1 }' fstab

2) Use the sort command to sort the /etc/passwd file to sort first by group id and then by user id.
   sort -t: -k4,4n -k3,3n passwd

3) Find the ip address of a system from the info presented by issuing the command ifconfig -a .
   Display only the ip address.
   ifconfig -a | awk '/cast/ { print $2 }' 

4) Open a Terminal. Export a variable Xvar=something. Now open a new terminal by opening a new Tab and see whether the variable Xvar exists?
   Why so? Now create a child bash shell within the terminal. Now see whether the variable Xvar exists or not?
   What can you conclude?

   Terminal created by New Tab is not a child process of the previous terminal program?

5) You run the script:

    #!/bin/bash

    if cd /tmp/x
    then
         :
    else
         echo could not change to /tmp/x
         exit 1
    fi

    What is the exit status of the script?
   
    Ans: 0
